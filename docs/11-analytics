We've created an official gem for [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com).

This gem automatically tracks and sends state changes to Mixpanel. They are sent to Mixpanel each time a state transition takes place. The user's `recipient_id` is sent to Mixpanel as the `distinct_id`. Additional properties for flow and state are also sent with the event. This allows you to build custom funnels and custom events as you wish.


Checkout the official [stealth-mixpanel](https://github.com/hellostealth/stealth-mixpanel) docs for more information.
