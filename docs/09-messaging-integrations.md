Stealth is designed for your bot to support one or many Messaging Services. For example, this could be SMS or both SMS and Facebook messenger. Messaging Integrations can be attached to your Stealth bot by adding the messaging integration gem to your `Gemfile`.

## `Gemfile`

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby '2.5.1'

gem 'stealth', '~> 0.10.0'

# Uncomment to enable the Stealth Facebook Driver
# gem 'stealth-facebook'

# Uncomment to enable the Stealth Twilio SMS Driver
# gem 'stealth-twilio'
```


## `services.yml`

```yml

  #       - locale: default
  #         text: "Welcome to the Stealth bot ðŸ¤–"
  #     persistent_menu:

## `sealth setup`

Most Messaging integrations require a initial setup. For example, Facebook requires you to send a payload to define the default greeting and persistent menu. You can accomplish this by running the `stealth setup` followed by the integration. For example:

`stealth setup facebook`

Make sure to reference the specific messaging integration for more specifics.
