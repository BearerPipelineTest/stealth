Like Messaging Inetegrations, Stealth also has official support for NLP and Machine Learning using Amazon Comprehend using our gem `stealth-aws-comprehend`

This gem adds the following methods to `current_message`:

1. `language` identifies text written in over 100 languages and returns the dominant language in `current_message` with a confidence score

2. `entities` returns the named entities ("People," "Places," "Locations," etc.) present in `current_message`

3. `key_phrases` returns the key phrases or talking points and a confidence score to support for the `current_message`

4. `sentiment` returns the overall sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Mixed) for the `current_message`

5. `sentiment_score` returns the scoring for each sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Mixed) for the `current_message`
